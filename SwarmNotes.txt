Okay, so how shall we do this?

Requirements:

// Kilobot

While these are not the minimum set of functions needed
for a collective robot, they strike a balance between what
behaviors a collective of robots is capable of, and the cost
of that collective. 

1) move forward, 2) rotate, 3) communicate with nearby
neighbors, 4) measure distance to nearby neighbors, and
5) have sufficient memory

Collective: programming, battery charging, turning on/off


//Our Robot

Individually:

Move Forward
Rotate
Be programmable
Wirelessly receive signals
? Tell distance to objects
IR fingerprint


Communal:

Mass programming?
Mass recharging
Mass turning on/off

// Our Robot, Thoughts
We get rid of the encoder requirement for driving straight by closing the feedback loop with 

//Project Milestones

One robot driving straight, turning based on webcam feedback
Tracking more than one object at appropriate speeds (tie something to a string)

Simulation software
Imitate one robot




Todo:
Create jobs list and news site for makers 
Aggregates cool youtube videos
